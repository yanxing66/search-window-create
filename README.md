#I use java GUI to achieve  little Simulation  Search Engine
#This is an application where you type a word into a text field and matches words in a dictionary. Whatever is currently in the text field updates what appears in the text box. 
#We will have menu bar which help us open the file and exit the search.
#The text box should update constantly as the user types. Pressing Enter should not be necessary
#When the program is run, it starts empty. It will be able to load a list of words from the file words.If none of the words contain the query, the text box should be empty.
#The Clear button should clear the query field, restoring the list box to displaying all words again.
